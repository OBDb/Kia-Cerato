generations:
  - name: "First Generation (LD)"
    start_year: 2003
    end_year: 2008
    description: "The original Kia Cerato (sold as the Spectra in North America and Forte in some other markets) was a compact sedan and hatchback designed to compete in the global C-segment. Featuring conservative styling typical of early 2000s Korean vehicles, it represented a step forward in Kia's design and quality compared to previous models. Available with various four-cylinder engines depending on the market, typically ranging from 1.5L to 2.0L, paired with manual or automatic transmissions. The interior offered good space and practicality for its class, though materials and build quality were basic by today's standards. This generation established the Cerato/Spectra/Forte as Kia's global compact car, though it still positioned primarily as a value alternative to established competitors like the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic."

    description: "The second-generation Cerato featured more dynamic styling under the direction of Peter Schreyer, showcasing Kia's evolving design language with the early version of the 'tiger nose' grille. Available in sedan and two-door coupe (Koup) body styles in most markets, with a five-door hatchback added later. Engine options evolved to include more efficient and powerful units, typically 1.6L and 2.0L four-cylinders with improved technology including direct injection in some variants. The interior saw significant improvements in design, material quality, and features, offering amenities like Bluetooth connectivity, better audio systems, and improved safety equipment. This generation represented a major step forward in the model's refinement, quality, and market positioning, helping to transform Kia's image from a purely budget brand to a more mainstream competitor."

    description: "The third-generation Cerato featured more sophisticated styling with a sleeker profile and more distinctive interpretation of Kia's 'tiger nose' grille. Available in sedan, five-door hatchback, and two-door coupe body styles depending on the market. Built on an updated platform with increased use of high-strength steel, it offered improved structural rigidity, safety, and handling. Engine options typically included 1.6L and 2.0L four-cylinders with direct injection technology in higher trims, paired with six-speed manual or automatic transmissions. The interior offered a more premium feel with better materials, design, and technology, including available features like a touchscreen infotainment system, rearview camera, and advanced safety systems. This generation further established the Cerato/Forte as a serious competitor in the compact car segment, offering a compelling combination of style, features, and value."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (BD)"
    start_year: 2018
    end_year: 2024
    description: "The current Cerato features more mature styling with clean lines, a fastback-inspired profile in the sedan, and sophisticated detailing. Available primarily in sedan and five-door hatchback body styles, with the coupe variant discontinued in most markets. Built on Kia's K2 platform shared with the Ceed, it offers improved driving dynamics, refinement, and safety. Engine options vary by market but typically include efficient 1.5L, 1.6L, and 2.0L four-cylinder units, with performance-oriented GT models featuring a 1.6L turbocharged engine in some regions. Transmission options include manual, conventional automatic, and continuously variable transmissions depending on configuration. The interior represents a major step forward with a more premium design, higher quality materials, and advanced technology including an available 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system, digital instrument cluster, and comprehensive connectivity features. Safety technology has advanced significantly with Kia's DriveWise suite including features like autonomous emergency braking, lane keeping assist, and adaptive cruise control. This generation competes directly with established compact cars on quality and features while maintaining Kia's value proposition, positioning the Cerato/Forte as a mainstream rather than budget alternative in the highly competitive compact car segment."
